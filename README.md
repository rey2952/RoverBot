A bot specially designed for [AC:CF Wiimmfi Server](https://discord.gg/yB8qyQh). The server has a purpose of uniting people that still play AC:CF over [Wiimmfi](wiimmfi.de) so that they can play / collaborate easily.

## Commands

* `!help` List all the commands that are available

## Inviting

The bot is designed especially for a specific server, so there isn't a bot invite link. You may setup the bot yourself since the code is open source but don't expect that it will work properly on your own server. *especially since the bot isn't coded very well*

## Setting up on your own

1. `git clone`
2. `cd RoverBot`
3. Edit config files (Fill in your bot token and edit prefixes)
4. `npm install`
5. `node bot.js`
